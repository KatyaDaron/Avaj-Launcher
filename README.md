# About the project
Frankfurt airport recently discovered that due to frequent weather changes they have a
bottleneck on some of the landing tracks. In order to find a solution, they first need to
know which scenarios create the worst bottlenecks. So they decided to use a simulator
where they configure and analyze multiple scenarios and hope that this will highlight
them were the real problem is.
